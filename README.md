📘 Overview

The Influencer Marketing Decentralized Application (DApp) is a Web3-based platform that allows users to create posts, receive “likes” as cryptocurrency rewards, and connect securely through crypto wallets.
Built using Ethereum smart contracts, Vite.js, and ThirdWeb, this project demonstrates how blockchain can power transparent, incentive-driven social interactions without intermediaries.

Unlike traditional web applications, this DApp runs entirely on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and trustless interactions between users.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Smart Contract Integration – Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to manage posts, likes, and rewards.
✅ Crypto Wallet Connection – Uses MetaMask for secure authentication and blockchain transactions.
✅ Post Creation & Liking System – Users can create posts and reward others with cryptocurrency “likes.”
✅ ThirdWeb SDK – Simplifies smart contract deployment and management.
✅ GoerliETH Test Network – Used for testing and validation in a sandbox environment.
✅ Vite.js Frontend – Delivers a fast and responsive interface for smooth interaction.

⚙️ Architecture Components

Smart Contract (InfluMar.sol)

Defines core business logic for post creation, user interactions, and token transfers.

Deployed on Ethereum testnet (Goerli).

ThirdWeb Integration

Manages contract deployment, function calls, and blockchain events via an intuitive API.

Provides dashboard tools for contract monitoring and analytics.

Frontend (Vite.js + JavaScript)

Modern, fast, and lightweight UI for interacting with blockchain functions.

Users can connect MetaMask, view posts, and like or comment.

MetaMask Wallet

Enables wallet connection, transaction signing, and secure user authentication.

GoerliETH Network

Serves as the Ethereum test network for safe and cost-free deployment testing.

🧩 Functional Requirements

Home Page: Displays navigation and “Connect Wallet” button.

Create Post: Form to submit title, description, image URL, and wallet address.

View Post: Displays all posts from the blockchain.

Like Feature: Clicking “Like” triggers a MetaMask transaction that rewards the post creator.

🛡️ Non-Functional Requirements

Security: End-to-end encryption via MetaMask and blockchain immutability.

Scalability: Designed to handle a growing user base through optimized smart contract design.

Privacy: Users can remain pseudonymous; no personal data storage.

Performance: Vite.js ensures smooth UI and fast transaction feedback.

Maintainability: Well-documented smart contracts and modular frontend codebase.

🌐 Deployment & Demo

Local Hosting: Run npm run dev in the client folder to start the application.

Test Network: GoerliETH (Ethereum Testnet).
